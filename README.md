trainingwheels.github.com
=========================

The generated gettrainingwheels.org website. Changes go in the repo `gettrainingwheels.org`.

How to build this site
----------------------

This site is generated by `yeoman build`. The build overwrites the full directory into which it's built, so therefore we need to copy the build files from the yeoman output into the repo.

1. Clone this repo alongside the gettrainingwheels.org repo:

```bash
cd ../
git clone git@github.com:trainingwheels/trainingwheels.github.com.git
```

The directory structure should be:

```bash
/path/to/gettrainingwheels.org
/path/to/trainingwheels.github.com
```

2. Run the `yeoman build` command in the `gettrainingwheels.org` repo.

3. Clear out the files from the previous build, then copy the contents of the `dist` build folder to the repo you checked out, and add the changes to a new commit. There may be some file deletions:

```bash
rm -Rf ../trainingwheels.github.com/*
cp -Rf dist/* ../trainingwheels.github.com
cd ../trainingwheels.github.com
git add -A
```

4. Confirm the changes commit and push.

```bash
git status
git commit -m "[your update message]"
git push
```
